I have 3 years of experience working on production systems for a couple of Indian states helping the under privileged strata of the population thanks to the amazing opportunities and problems I got to work on during my time at Samagra. Presently, I ship code at Zomato trying to get simplify the lives of merchants on the platform.\nI was part of the core team that built Bharat Sah’AI’yak which was acquired by OLA Krutrim in early 2025. BSAI is a AI enabled compute platform which could be modified for a wide range of usecases like ChatBots, information processing systems etc.\nI have a deep love for databases, distributed systems, PLT and open source.

Another thing which was special about MahaKumbh BSAI adoption was that it was the first time where external teams like OLA Krutrim and BeeHyv used and built on top of BSAI proving that the platform was mature enough to onboard external teams to just use the developer platform and build on top of it to power population scale use cases.\nBSAI was ultimately acquired by OLA Krutrim in early 2025 and is currently being worked on as part of Krutrim’s larger vision of building India’s own state of the art AI agent."},"projects/index":{"slug":"projects/index","filePath":"projects/_index.md","title":"My Work","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I started programming in 2020 during CoVID-19 quarantine lockdown right after I graduated high school and appeard for JEE.
