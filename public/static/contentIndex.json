I have 3 years of experience working on production systems which are deployed in couple of Indian states helping the under privileged strata of the population thanks to the projects I got to work on during my time at Samagra. Presently, I ship code at Zomato trying to get simplify merchant’s lives who help those of us with busy lives with a hot meal when we are too occupied with our hustle.\nI am deeply interested in building scalable large scale systems, simplifying developer workflows and sustainably building for AI. The most recent areas of interest I have are datacentres because of the advent in AI agents like [cursor], [claude code] etc."}}
