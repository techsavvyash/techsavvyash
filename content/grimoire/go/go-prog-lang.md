## Chapter 1

- go has no notion of enclosing conditions in `(`
- the built in function `make` can be used to create a new `map`
- The order of map iteration in go is random varying from program run to run
- The `map` is actually a reference to a data-structure created by make
- `ReadFile` returns a byte slice
- http.<METHOD> returns a struct (expected)
- resp.body is a stream
