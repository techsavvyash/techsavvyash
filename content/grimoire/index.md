Welcome to my Grimoire. I find programming and software engineering to be wizardy hence the name of my vault for notes is Grimoire.

This is the place where all my technical learnings and notes are stored, I initially had a scattered obsidian vault for them, but then one day I came across quartz and thought, why not make the notes public atleast that way I'll be able to hold myself more accountable to write more cleanly and also build an online presence and help those like me who are looking for resources but have to find their way through numerous different resources scattered all across the web.
