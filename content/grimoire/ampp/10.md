# Queues, memory management and the ABA problem

## Pools

- A pool is similar to a `Set` with the following two distinctions:
  - might not have a `contains()` method for testing membership
  - allows duplicate elements
- Pools usually act as buffers in producer<>consumer systems.
- Types of `Pool`:
  - **Bounded**:
    - Number of items == `capacity`
    - Useful when we want to limit the consumer lag.
  - **Unbounded**
    - Unlimited number of items
    - Useful when we can't fix a upper cap on the consumer lag.
