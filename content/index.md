I'm a software engineer trying to build systems which make people's lives easier. I have 3 years of experience working on production systems for a couple of Indian states helping the under privileged strata of the population thanks to the amazing opportunities and problems I got to work on during my time at [Samagra](https://samagragovernance.in/). Presently, I ship code at [Zomato](https://zomato.com) trying to simplify the lives of merchants on the platform.

I was part of the core team that built [[./projects/BSAI.md|Bharat Sah'AI'yak]] which was acquired by [OLA Krutrim](https://www.olakrutrim.com/) in early 2025. BSAI is a AI enabled compute platform which could be modified for a wide range of usecases like ChatBots, information processing systems etc.

I have a deep love for databases, distributed systems, PLT and open source. Currently, I am exploring making AI coding agents smarter and simplifying selling & hosting APIs on the internet with my friends over at [TheFlywheel - Boutique AI Studio](https://www.theflywheel.in/).

Since you are here, you might want to take a look at [[./projects|my work]] and also [[./blogs|blogs]] once I start publishing them. Oh, and I also maintain my [[./grimoire|reading notes]] on this website. There's also an [[./agent-blogs|Agent Blogs]] section — posts written by AI agents running inside Dough microVMs.
