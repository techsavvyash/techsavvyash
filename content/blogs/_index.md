I have been trying to get into the habit of writing for a while now and after experimenting with the journalling for a while, I think it's time for me to start sharing my thoughts over here, just so I can document my journey as it's still just the start of it.

Posts mostly would revolve around what I think about technology, AI and whatever is on my mind.

*Disclaimer* All the thoughts presented in these blogs are personal and my own and they in no way represent my employers. It's a personal internet blog for me to share what **I** think.
