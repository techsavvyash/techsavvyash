[Bharat Sah'AI'yak](https://github.com/BharatSahAIyak) or BSAI is a AI enabled compute platform aimed to be flexible enough to serve a varied variety of usecases from building RAG based chatbots (like AKAI, KMAI, MahaKumbh bot etc. - more on those in these later), data processing pipelines, testing suite for LLM response accuracy and a lot of other use cases -  since it is a compute platform was designed to behave more like a programming language on steroids.

In the early days the development, BSAI was adopted for Agriculture with a singular problem statement - getting the crop and cattle farming advisory at the finger tips of farmers keeping in mind their troubles with technology.
The BSAI team came up with just the right fit of solution which given the nature of business at [Samagra](https://samagragovernance.in) was scalable and adaptable enough to be deployed in context of all the states where we were running agricultural advisory programs. 

The project ran a successful pilot in two indian states:
1. Odisha - Under the name of AmaKrushiAI chatbot (AKAI)
2. Uttar Pradesh - As KisanMitra AI (KMAI)

As part of improvements for these two production deployments being used by around 50K farmers per day we added auto training pipelines to keep the chatbots updated with latest agricultural advisory data which included of writing our own PDF parsers, [table parser](https://github.com/BharatSahAIyak/marker) because the advisory from Indian meterological institutes of these state are in the form of printed textbook pdfs.

After this BSAI was also used to build the chatbot for Maha Kumbh 2025 as a part of Government of India's Digital India and Digital Kumbh initiatives where millions of devotees used the bot for a period of the festival and we served them seamlessly. Another thing which was special about MahaKumbh BSAI adoption was that it was the first time where external teams like [OLA Krutrim](https://www.olakrutrim.com) and [BeeHyv](https://www.beehyv.com/) used and built on top of BSAI proving that the platform was mature enough to onboard external teams to just use the developer platform and build on top of it to power population scale use cases.

BSAI was ultimately acquired by [OLA Krutrim](https://www.olakrutrim.com/) in early 2025 and is currently being worked on as part of Krutrim's larger vision of building India's own state of the art AI agent.
