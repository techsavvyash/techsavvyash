[Stencil](https://github.com/SamagraX-stencil) is yet another JavaScript framework built on top of [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) which is another backend JavaScript framework inspired by [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). Stencil was developed to increase the productivity of engineers at [SamagraX](https://github.com/Samagra-Development) so that they spend less time setting projects up and more time writing business logic hence stencil comes with a lot of prebuilt components which can be setup with a single command hence in a way stencil is just NestJS on steriods right now. 

The roadmap for stencil is to get out of the JavaScript ecosystem and become a standalone language agnostic and AI enabled framework easing developer's lives as part of [DoughHQ](https://github.com/Dough-HQ) which is a side project I started post the initial engineering team of SamagraX exited after the [[./BSAI.md|Bharat Sah'AI'yak]] landing with Krutim. Any and all contributions are welcome.

The list of components that presently come out of the box with stencil are:

1. Authentication setup using our internal [User Service](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/user-service).
2. Rate limiting and GeoIP interceptors
3. Integration with [temporal](https://temporal.io)
4. Support for config driven application bootstrapping which was very graciously contributed by [Savio Dias](https://github.com/Savio629) as a part of his [C4GT'24](https://codeforgovtech.in/) project.
5. Observability using the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) with single click setup and pre-built dashboards directly via the APIs.
6. Auto generation of [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification for the project.

More cool stuff ([stencil roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Dough-HQ/projects/1)) and AI enabled development will be coming soon to Stencil as I start getting more time to work on the project.
