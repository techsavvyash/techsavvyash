[OIDC Lite](https://github.com/techsavvyash/oidc-lite) is a project I built with my college friends [Debatreya](https://github.com/Debatreya), [Utkarsh](https://github.com/Zolo-Ryan) & [Ashutosh](https://github.com/Ashu463) to learn more about the [OIDC protocol](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) and also because we wanted a lighter alternative to [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/) and [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) which are great feature rich projects but for most usecases we don't need those features and while rolling your own auth is fun, it gets boring and repeatitive after a couple of times, hence as a result, OIDC light was born, which could be used as a authentication solution similar to FA and Keycloak but without the bloat.

You can read more about the project in the [OIDC Lite docs](https://techsavvyash.github.io/oidc-lite/).
